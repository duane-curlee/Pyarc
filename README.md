# pyarch
Python archiver, a script to create a backup zip file of your files and folders

Hello, world.

I am making a platform-independent Python archiver that will make a backup file (a zip file) in the fashion of cPanel's Backup program. It should drop the zip archive in your home folder. It will allow you to select your folders from your home folder and remember your choices. I plan to make it GUI-based, but it is only command line as of now.
